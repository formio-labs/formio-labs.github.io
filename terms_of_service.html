<h2 id="11arbitrationclauseclassactionwaiver">11. ARBITRATION CLAUSE &amp; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong>


<ol>
<li>Either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</li>

<li>The arbitrator, and not any federal, provincial, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li></ol>
</li>

<li><strong>Location:</strong> For residents in Canada and the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the Province of Ontario, Canada, and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or provincial court in Toronto,Ontario or Ottawa, Ontario in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</li>

YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>

<li><strong>Exception–Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong> Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state, provincial or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</li>

<li><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out:</strong> You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Formio Labs, Inc., 416-205 Manning Ave., Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M6J 0E2.
